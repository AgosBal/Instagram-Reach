Using the Google Trends API with Python, I intend to analyse and list the Google Search results on queries related to "when is it ideal to post on social networks".

The code is [here](Google.Search.Analysis.ipynb)


# Instagram Forecast
While social media is part of our daily lives, we have a life outside of it and are not always connected.

I did a little analysis on the search for "when is the ideal time to post": [here](Google.Search.Analysis.ipynb). Were I discovered that people are still looking for information related to this topic.

So, knowing the ideal time to post on Instagram can be useful for those who use Instagram as a means of contacting their customers and prospects, if they know their content is going to be of interest.

This project aims to help these people by showing them how many visitors will see their post, story, reel, etc, so that they can plan their strategies in the best way, hopefully resulting in metrics showing improved performance and therefore greater success. Instagram reach prediction helps to know how many users will be reached by content posted on Instagram, based on historical data, among other factors.

For this case I will use this [dataset](Instagram-Reach.csv) and the process will be done in [Python](Instagram.Forecast.ipynb).
